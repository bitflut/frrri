FRRRI (the racing car) is a collection of libraries for Angular and Nest to simplify CRUD communication. The @frrri/ngxs-crud library is ready for preview now.

They can be used together or separately with any other frontend or backend implementation. They are built to be highly flexible and easily extensible.

See [Quick start](https://bitflut.gitbook.io/frrri/) for minimal setup instructions.
