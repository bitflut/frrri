# Usage

There are quite a few concepts to be explained. Please see the [integration example in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitflut/lyxs/tree/master/apps/ng-integration) until documentation catches up.

**@lyxs/angular** aims at making it easy to configure your components data layer via the **angular router**. This way, your components are highly reusable and can display different sets of data for different routes easily. Have a look at [posts-routing.module.ts](https://github.com/bitflut/lyxs/blob/master/apps/ng-integration/src/app/posts/posts-routing.module.ts) in the ng-intergation example on GitHub for examples.
