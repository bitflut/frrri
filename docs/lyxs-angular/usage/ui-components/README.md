# UI Components

## Streamline your view layer

To streamline your view layer **@lyxs/angular provides three components** to show __**collections**, a **single entity** of a collection, or the **active entity** of the collection.

You can see them in action in the `posts-index.component.html` and `posts-show.component.html` templates \(found [here](https://github.com/bitflut/lyxs/blob/master/apps/ng-integration/src/app/posts)\).
