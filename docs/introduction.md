# Introduction

**LYXS** will become a collection of libraries for Angular and NestJS to simplify CRUD for API and angular frontends. The **@lyxs/angular** library is ready for preview now.

### @lyxs/angular

{% hint style="info" %}
@lyxs/angular is not yet intended for production use. Please help us get to v1.0.0 by providing feedback. All documented functions are tested and confirmed to work for our internal use cases.
{% endhint %}

We suggest reading through the [Usage chapter](lyxs-angular/usage/) in order to understand all basic intentions of @lyxs/angular.

See [Installation](lyxs-angular/installation.md) for minimal setup instructions.
